## Bye, Bye, Captcha!

### A quick history about Captcha.
CAPTCHA is an abbreviation for **C**ompletely **A**utomated **P**ublic **T**uring **T**est to **T**ell **C**omputers and **H**umans **A**part. *Well, quite a long name*. It was created to separate Bots from Humans. Initially, it was successful, but as humans fill in more and more Captchas, scammers use machine learning to catch up with the Captcha tests making captcha tests more difficult.

### Captcha are everywhere on the internet.
