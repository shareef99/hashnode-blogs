## The correct way of asking questions.

**Hello Developers**

I am an intermediate developer. I had great mentors to whom I could ask any question and they would help me. Now, as time passes I get many questions from the juniors, but I think they lack the ability to ask a question properly. Well, you might ask who I am to lecture on this topic? I learned basically everything from asking questions and googling stuff.

## Try to google before asking the question.
Google is an essential skill for any developer/programmer. Whenever you are struck first approve Google.
### Example
Before Googling

**You:** How should I pass a child state to a parent state?.

**Mentor:** Have you googled it?.

**You:** No...

After Googling

**You:** I am unable to pass child state to parent state. I googled it and it says [this] and [this].  

**Mentor:** Okay, do [this] and refer to [this] article.

## Tell us the real problem.

Okay, let's say you are working on the front-end part of the project, and upon fetching data from the API you run into a CORS error. You google it and are still unable to solve it.

### Example

before not mentioning the real problem.

**You:** I am trying to solve the CORS error and I did [this] and [this].

**Mentor:** CORS are tricky. I can't exactly solve your problem.

After mentioning the real problem.

**You:** While fetching the data from the API, I ran into a CORS error and I did [this] and [this].

**Mentor:** Maybe the API is not handling requests properly. Submit the response and logs to the backend team.

## Some tips.
- Try to solve before asking the question.
- Google, Google, and Google.
- Ask the real question, not the solution you are working on.
- If you are stuck on a problem for too long, take a break.
- And above all, ask the question.

**HappyCoding**
